 <h5>Subscription process</h5>
<P>When the user wants to sign up the application, he or she has to go to the main page and push the "Sign up" button. Once this has been done, 3 boxes will appear and they have to be filled out respectively with:
the user's first name or nickname, an e-mail address and a password.

 <h5>Actual application use</h5>

After opening the application, the homepage will be displayed, and the user will need to decide whether to register or log in if already registered. Once logged in, the user can create and manage their personalized training sessions by pressing a button that will display the days of the week for which they can create their workouts. By clicking on any day, a table will be shown where the user can enter their exercises, including name, sets, repetitions, type of exercise, rest time, and links to images or videos for perfect execution. Once the exercises have been added, the user can save and finalize the weekly workout, which will be saved via a dedicated button.
