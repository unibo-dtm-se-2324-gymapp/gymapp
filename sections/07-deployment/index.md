- **Database:** lolal storage
- **Server:** Python

## System Requirements
- **Python:** Version 3.8 or later
- **Git**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Flask**
- **Flask-CORS**

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Python 3.8 or later:** This application requires Python 3.8 or later. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
- **pip:** Python should come with `pip`, the package manager. If itâ€™s not already installed, you can follow the [official pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

-**1st step**
The first step is to clone the repository settled in github with the command 'git clone https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2324-gymapp/gymapp.git' and then access it.

-**2nd step**
Create a virtual environment, by following these instructions:(optional but recommended):
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

-**3rd step**
You need to install Flask and Flask Cors if are not present in your device. You can do it by installing the file Requirements.txt that is in the application's folder.

-**Running the application:**
To start the gymapp application run the command "python Sixpack.py"

At this point the application will be running in debug mode and will be accessible via your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

-**Troubleshooting:**
Error: ModuleNotFoundError: If you encounter an error indicating that a module is not found, make sure you have correctly run the command pip install -r requirements.txt.
Port 5000 already in use: If port 5000 is already in use, you can run the application on a different port by modifying the last line of the app.py file: app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
