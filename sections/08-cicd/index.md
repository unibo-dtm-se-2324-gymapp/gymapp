# CI/CD

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Workflow for "Sixpack"

The CI/CD pipeline for the Sixpack application is tailored to streamline and optimize the integration, testing, and deployment of changes to both the backend, built with FastAPI, and the frontend, developed using Vue.js. By automating key stages of the development workflow—such as code validation, dependency management, testing, building, and deployment—the pipeline minimizes manual effort and reduces the risk of human error. This ensures that potential issues are detected and addressed early in the development cycle. Furthermore, the pipeline enables the rapid delivery of new features and fixes by supporting continuous updates, keeping the application in a deployable state at all times. This robust process improves the reliability, scalability, and overall performance of Sixpack, ensuring it meets both current requirements and future growth demands.

## Why CI/CD for Sixpack?

The implementation of a robust CI/CD pipeline for the Sixpack application offers significant advantages tailored to its unique requirements:

- **Consistent Code Quality**: The pipeline enforces automated testing for both the FastAPI backend and Vue.js frontend, ensuring that every commit meets strict quality standards. This approach prevents errors from reaching production and maintains a stable application experience for users.

- **Faster Feature Delivery**: By automating key processes like integration, testing, and deployment, the CI/CD pipeline reduces delays in rolling out new features or bug fixes. This ensures a shorter time-to-market, enabling users to benefit from updates more quickly.

- **Scalability**: As Sixpack grows, both in features and user base, the CI/CD pipeline is designed to handle increased complexity seamlessly. It provides a scalable framework that can adapt to evolving project demands, including larger codebases and more extensive testing requirements.

- **Improved Developer Productivity**: Automating routine and repetitive tasks allows the development team to focus on enhancing Sixpack’s core functionalities. This not only improves efficiency but also reduces overall development costs by minimizing manual interventions in the workflow.

## CI/CD Workflow for Sixpack

### Backend (FastAPI) CI/CD Process

1. **Python Environment Setup**: 
   - The pipeline configures Python 3.9 on the CI server to ensure compatibility with FastAPI.
   - Virtual environments are created to isolate dependencies.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Dependencies are installed using Poetry, guaranteeing consistency across environments.

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Tests are executed using `pytest`, covering:
     - API endpoints (e.g., user registration, session management).
     - Database interactions.
     - Edge cases for data validation.

4. **Build and Deployment**:
   - After successful tests, the backend is packaged and deployed to environments like TestPyPI or production servers.
   - A GitHub Release is generated for version tracking.

### Frontend (Vue.js) CI/CD Process

1. **Node.js Environment Setup**:
   - Node.js and npm are configured to manage the Vue.js application.

2. **Dependency Installation**:
   - Frontend libraries are installed using npm or Yarn, ensuring up-to-date packages.

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Tests include:
     - Unit tests with Jest to validate individual components.
     - Integration tests to verify interactions with the backend (e.g., login functionality).

4. **Build Process**:
   - The application is compiled, bundling JavaScript, CSS, and static assets.

5. **Deployment**:
   - The built frontend is deployed to GitHub Pages or an equivalent hosting service.

### GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

The CI/CD pipeline leverages GitHub Actions for automation. A shared configuration is used for both backend and frontend pipelines, triggered upon each commit or pull request.

#### Workflow Steps:
1. **Code Checkout**:
   - Retrieves the latest repository state for both backend and frontend.

2. **Dependency Installation**:
   - Installs backend dependencies via Poetry and frontend dependencies via npm/Yarn.

3. **Testing**:
   - Executes `pytest` for backend and Jest for frontend to validate functionality.

4. **Build**:
   - Compiles both backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Vue.js) into deployable packages.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Backend is deployed to TestPyPI or production servers.
   - Frontend is deployed to GitHub Pages or similar platforms.

**Sample GitHub Actions YAML for Backend**:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline - Backend

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          pip install poetry
          poetry install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          pytest

      - name: Deploy to TestPyPI
        run: |
          poetry publish --repository testpypi
