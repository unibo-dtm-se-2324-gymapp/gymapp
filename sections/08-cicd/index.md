# CI/CD

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Workflow for "Sixpack"

The CI/CD pipeline for the Sixpack application is tailored to streamline and optimize the integration, testing, and deployment of changes to both the backend, built with FastAPI, and the frontend, developed using Vue.js. By automating key stages of the development workflow—such as code validation, dependency management, testing, building, and deployment—the pipeline minimizes manual effort and reduces the risk of human error. This ensures that potential issues are detected and addressed early in the development cycle. Furthermore, the pipeline enables the rapid delivery of new features and fixes by supporting continuous updates, keeping the application in a deployable state at all times. This robust process improves the reliability, scalability, and overall performance of Sixpack, ensuring it meets both current requirements and future growth demands.

## Why CI/CD for Sixpack?

Implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline for Sixpack brings several advantages:

- **Consistent Code Quality**: Automated testing guarantees that every commit adheres to predefined quality standards, preventing errors from propagating to production.
- **Rapid Feature Deployment**: Automation minimizes delays in integrating and deploying new features, enabling a faster time-to-market.
- **Scalability**: The CI/CD pipeline is designed to grow alongside the project, handling increased complexity with ease.
- **Developer Efficiency**: By automating routine tasks, developers can focus on feature development, reducing overall development costs.

## CI/CD Workflow for Sixpack

### Backend (FastAPI) CI/CD Process

1. **Python Environment Setup**: 
   - The pipeline configures Python 3.9 on the CI server to ensure compatibility with FastAPI.
   - Virtual environments are created to isolate dependencies.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Dependencies are installed using Poetry, guaranteeing consistency across environments.

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Tests are executed using `pytest`, covering:
     - API endpoints (e.g., user registration, session management).
     - Database interactions.
     - Edge cases for data validation.

4. **Build and Deployment**:
   - After successful tests, the backend is packaged and deployed to environments like TestPyPI or production servers.
   - A GitHub Release is generated for version tracking.

### Frontend (Vue.js) CI/CD Process

1. **Node.js Environment Setup**:
   - Node.js and npm are configured to manage the Vue.js application.

2. **Dependency Installation**:
   - Frontend libraries are installed using npm or Yarn, ensuring up-to-date packages.

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Tests include:
     - Unit tests with Jest to validate individual components.
     - Integration tests to verify interactions with the backend (e.g., login functionality).

4. **Build Process**:
   - The application is compiled, bundling JavaScript, CSS, and static assets.

5. **Deployment**:
   - The built frontend is deployed to GitHub Pages or an equivalent hosting service.

### GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

The CI/CD pipeline leverages GitHub Actions for automation. A shared configuration is used for both backend and frontend pipelines, triggered upon each commit or pull request.

#### Workflow Steps:
1. **Code Checkout**:
   - Retrieves the latest repository state for both backend and frontend.

2. **Dependency Installation**:
   - Installs backend dependencies via Poetry and frontend dependencies via npm/Yarn.

3. **Testing**:
   - Executes `pytest` for backend and Jest for frontend to validate functionality.

4. **Build**:
   - Compiles both backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Vue.js) into deployable packages.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Backend is deployed to TestPyPI or production servers.
   - Frontend is deployed to GitHub Pages or similar platforms.

**Sample GitHub Actions YAML for Backend**:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline - Backend

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          pip install poetry
          poetry install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          pytest

      - name: Deploy to TestPyPI
        run: |
          poetry publish --repository testpypi
