# CI/CD


## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Workflow for "Sixpack"

The CI/CD pipeline for the Sixpack application is tailored to streamline and optimize the integration, testing, and deployment of changes to both the backend, built with FastAPI, and the frontend, developed using Vue.js. By automating key stages of the development workflow—such as code validation, dependency management, testing, building, and deployment—the pipeline minimizes manual effort and reduces the risk of human error. This ensures that potential issues are detected and addressed early in the development cycle. Furthermore, the pipeline enables the rapid delivery of new features and fixes by supporting continuous updates, keeping the application in a deployable state at all times. This robust process improves the reliability, scalability, and overall performance of Sixpack, ensuring it meets both current requirements and future growth demands.

## Why CI/CD for Sixpack?

The implementation of a robust CI/CD pipeline for the Sixpack application offers significant advantages tailored to its unique requirements:

- **Consistent Code Quality**: The pipeline enforces automated testing for both the FastAPI backend and Vue.js frontend, ensuring that every commit meets strict quality standards. This approach prevents errors from reaching production and maintains a stable application experience for users.

- **Faster Feature Delivery**: By automating key processes like integration, testing, and deployment, the CI/CD pipeline reduces delays in rolling out new features or bug fixes. This ensures a shorter time-to-market, enabling users to benefit from updates more quickly.

- **Scalability**: As Sixpack grows, both in features and user base, the CI/CD pipeline is designed to handle increased complexity seamlessly. It provides a scalable framework that can adapt to evolving project demands, including larger codebases and more extensive testing requirements.

- **Improved Developer Productivity**: Automating routine and repetitive tasks allows the development team to focus on enhancing Sixpack’s core functionalities. This not only improves efficiency but also reduces overall development costs by minimizing manual interventions in the workflow.

## CI/CD Workflow for Sixpack

### Backend (FastAPI) CI/CD Process

The CI/CD pipeline for the Sixpack backend automates integration, testing, and deployment to ensure consistent quality and efficiency. Below are the detailed steps:

1. **Python Environment Setup**:
   - The pipeline configures Python 3.9 to ensure compatibility with FastAPI.
   - A virtual environment is created to isolate dependencies and prevent conflicts.

   ```yaml
   - name: Setup Python
     uses: actions/setup-python@v2
     with:
       python-version: '3.9'
   ```

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Dependencies are managed using **Poetry**, ensuring consistency across environments.
   - The pipeline installs all required libraries using `poetry install`.

   ```yaml
   - name: Install Dependencies
     run: |
       pip install poetry
       poetry install
   ```

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Tests are executed with **Pytest**, covering:
     - API endpoints (e.g., user registration, session management).
     - Database operations (e.g., reading and writing data).
     - Edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, empty responses).

   ```yaml
   - name: Run Tests
     run: |
       pytest
   ```

4. **Build and Deployment**:
   - After successful testing, the backend is packaged and deployed to **TestPyPI** or production servers.
   - A **GitHub Release** is created for version tracking and rollback purposes.

   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy to TestPyPI
     run: |
       poetry publish --repository testpypi
   ```

### Frontend (Vue.js) CI/CD Process

The CI/CD pipeline for the Vue.js frontend ensures that all changes are tested and deployed seamlessly. Below are the steps:

1. **Node.js Environment Setup**:
   - The pipeline configures Node.js to manage the Vue.js application and its dependencies.

   ```yaml
   - name: Setup Node.js
     uses: actions/setup-node@v2
     with:
       node-version: '16'
   ```

2. **Dependency Installation**:
   - The pipeline installs frontend dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

   ```yaml
   - name: Install Dependencies
     run: |
       npm install
   ```

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - **Jest** runs unit tests to validate Vue.js components.
   - Integration tests verify the interaction between frontend and backend.

   ```yaml
   - name: Run Tests
     run: |
       npm test
   ```

4. **Build Process**:
   - The application is compiled and optimized using Webpack, bundling JavaScript, CSS, and other static assets.

   ```yaml
   - name: Build Application
     run: |
       npm run build
   ```

5. **Deployment**:
   - The compiled assets are deployed to a static hosting platform like **GitHub Pages**, **Vercel**, or **AWS S3**.

   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
     run: |
       npm run deploy
   ```


---


### GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

Both backend and frontend workflows are orchestrated using **GitHub Actions**, enabling automation for every commit or pull request to the `main` branch.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Code Checkout**:
   Retrieves the latest repository state for testing and deployment.

   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout Code
     uses: actions/checkout@v2
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   Configures Python and Node.js environments for backend and frontend respectively.

3. **Dependency Installation**:
   Installs all required dependencies using Poetry for the backend and npm for the frontend.

4. **Automated Testing**:
   Executes `pytest` for backend testing and Jest/Cypress for frontend testing.

5. **Build and Deployment**:
   - Backend: Packages and deploys to TestPyPI or production servers.
   - Frontend: Compiles and deploys to a static hosting platform like GitHub Pages or Vercel.
