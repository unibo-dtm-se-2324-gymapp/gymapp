# CI/CD

The application Six-Pack backend is based on FastAPI, and the frontend uses Vue.js. The CI/CD process must reflect this.
Tailor the testing and deployment processes to align with the project's specific requirements, while maintaining automated testing, building, and deploying.

# CI/CD Strategy for "Six Pack" Application

The CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) process is an essential practice in modern software development, enabling the automation of testing, building, and deploying applications. 
For the Six Pack application, which consists of a FastAPI backend and a Vue.js frontend, the CI/CD pipeline ensures that the codebase is always in a deployable state. Through automated processes, we can continuously integrate code changes and deploy them efficiently, preventing potential errors and enabling faster releases: the CI/CD strategy for the Six Pack application, outlining how both the backend and frontend are integrated, built, tested, and deployed.

# Why implement CI/CD?

The adoption of a CI/CD pipeline for the Six Pack project offers several key advantages:

- Shorter Development Cycles: Automating key processes such as testing and deployment accelerates development, allowing features to be released quicker.
- Increased Efficiency: By eliminating manual intervention in the build and deployment processes, development time is optimized.
- Reliability: With every code change automatically tested, the risk of introducing errors is minimized, ensuring higher quality in production.
- Faster Time-to-Market: Automation reduces the delay between code submission and production deployment, which accelerates feature delivery to users.

This results in both reduced development costs and enhanced developer satisfaction as more time can be spent on feature development rather than routine tasks.

# CI/CD Strategy for the "Six Pack" Application

# Backend (FastAPI) CI/CD Process

The backend of the Six Pack application is built with FastAPI, a modern web framework for Python. The CI/CD pipeline for the backend ensures that the backend code is automatically tested, built, and deployed. This includes the following steps:

# 1. Python Environment Setup:

The pipeline sets up the appropriate Python environment to run the FastAPI backend.
This includes configuring a compatible version of Python (e.g., Python 3.9) on the CI server.

# 2. Dependency Management:

Poetry is used to manage backend dependencies. The pipeline installs the necessary dependencies using Poetry, ensuring that all required libraries are available before running tests or building the backend.

# 3. Automated Testing:

The pipeline runs tests for the backend using pytest. This ensures that any changes in the codebase are verified against existing test cases, preventing errors from reaching production.

# 4. Build and Deployment:

After successful testing, the FastAPI backend is built and deployed to TestPyPI or a production server, depending on the workflow stage.
The pipeline ensures that the backend is automatically deployed and that a GitHub Release is created, facilitating version tracking and distribution.

# Job Structure for Frontend (Vue.js)

The frontend of the Six Pack application is developed using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework. The CI/CD pipeline for the frontend is similar in structure but tailored for the Vue.js application. The key steps include:

# 1. Node.js Environment Setup:

The pipeline sets up the Node.js environment, necessary for running the Vue.js application and managing its dependencies.

# 2. Dependency Management:

npm or Yarn is used to install the required dependencies for the frontend. These tools are used to ensure the latest versions of frontend libraries are available.

# 3. Automated Testing:

Automated tests for the frontend are run to ensure that the user interface behaves as expected. This step helps verify that the UI components are functional and interact with the backend correctly.

# 4. Build Process:

The pipeline compiles the Vue.js application, which includes bundling JavaScript, CSS, and other static assets required by the frontend.

# 5. Deployment:

Once the build is successful, the frontend is deployed to GitHub Pages or a similar hosting platform, making it available to users. The pipeline ensures that the application is always up-to-date, reflecting the latest changes.

# GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

The workflows for both the backend and frontend are configured using GitHub Actions. These workflows are triggered automatically whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch of the respective repository. The key steps in each workflow are:


1. Code Checkout: This step retrieves the latest version of the repository, ensuring that the pipeline runs on the most up-to-date code.

2. Dependency Installation: The required dependencies for both the backend (Poetry for FastAPI) and frontend (npm or Yarn for Vue.js) are installed.

3. Testing: Automated tests are executed to validate the integrity of the code. These tests are tailored for each part of the application (backend and frontend).

4. Building: The code is compiled, and the assets are bundled to prepare for deployment.

5. Deployment: The application is deployed to the chosen environment (TestPyPI for the backend and GitHub Pages for the frontend).


# The Benefits of CI/CD for "Six Pack"

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline for Six Pack provides several notable advantages:

- Automation: The entire process of testing, building, and deploying is automated, reducing manual effort and human error.
- Faster Releases: By automating the integration and deployment process, new features and fixes can be deployed more quickly.
- Continuous Feedback: Automated tests provide continuous feedback to developers, helping them identify and address issues early in the development cycle.
- Reliability: With continuous testing and integration, the risk of introducing bugs into production is minimized, ensuring the application's stability.

# Conclusion

The CI/CD pipeline for Six Pack ensures that both the FastAPI backend and Vue.js frontend are tested, built, and deployed seamlessly. By integrating automated processes into the development workflow, the application benefits from faster development cycles, reliable releases, and improved software quality. The CI/CD approach enables the team to efficiently manage updates to both the frontend and backend, ensuring that the application is always in a deployable state and ready for users.
