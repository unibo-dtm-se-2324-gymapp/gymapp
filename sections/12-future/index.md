# Known Issues and Future Work for the "Six-Pack" Application

The **Six-Pack** application represents an innovative approach to fitness management, enabling users to organize and track their workout sessions with ease. While the application demonstrates significant potential through its foundational features, there are several limitations and opportunities for improvement. This section provides a detailed analysis of current issues and outlines potential advancements to transform Six-Pack into a comprehensive and competitive platform.


# What is Missing

Comprehensive Testing:
Unit Testing: Additional unit tests are needed to validate the functionality of core features, such as session and exercise management.
Integration Testing: More integration tests are necessary to ensure that the interaction between different components (e.g., backend and frontend) is stable and reliable.
End-to-End Testing: Automated testing that simulates user workflows (adding/modifying sessions, tracking progress) is currently lacking, which could help catch bugs in real-life scenarios.

# Potential Future Developments

Mobile Application:
Native iOS and Android Apps: Developing native mobile applications could provide users with a more seamless and accessible way to track their workout progress on the go.

Integration with Fitness Devices:
Wearables Integration: Syncing with popular fitness devices like smartwatches or fitness trackers to automatically track heart rate, steps, or calories burned during a session.

Real-time Notifications:
App Notifications: Currently, notifications (e.g., for completed sessions or reminders) are limited to basic methods. Implementing real-time, in-app notifications would enhance user experience by providing instant updates on their workout progress.

Integration of Multimedia (Optional):
Adding Exercise Videos and Images: If implemented, users will be able to add images or videos of exercises to visually guide them through workouts. This feature would be especially useful for new users unfamiliar with certain exercises.

Timer Functionality (Optional):
Exercise Timer: The possibility of adding a timer to track the duration of exercises could help users improve performance and ensure accurate rest periods between sets.

Social Features:
Progress Sharing: Introducing features that allow users to share their workout achievements or progress on social media or within the app community to foster motivation and engagement.

By addressing the current limitations and implementing these future developments, the "Six-Pack" application can offer a more robust, user-friendly experience, making it a comprehensive tool for fitness enthusiasts.
