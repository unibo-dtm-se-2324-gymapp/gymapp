# Known Issues and Future Work for the "Six-Pack" Application

The **Six-Pack** application represents an innovative approach to fitness management, enabling users to organize and track their workout sessions with ease. While the application demonstrates significant potential through its foundational features, there are several limitations and opportunities for improvement. This section provides a detailed analysis of current issues and outlines potential advancements to transform Six-Pack into a comprehensive and competitive platform.


## Known Issues

### 1. Insufficient Testing Framework
Robust software systems are underpinned by rigorous testing protocols, which are currently underdeveloped in the Six-Pack application.

- **Unit Testing**: Core functionalities such as creating, saving, and modifying workout sessions lack automated unit tests. The absence of these tests increases the risk of undetected regressions, particularly as new features are introduced.
- **Integration Testing**: There is no systematic testing to validate the interaction between the backend (Flask) and the frontend. For instance, data inconsistencies or session-saving issues could remain undetected due to the lack of middleware-level validation.
- **End-to-End Testing**: The application does not simulate user workflows (e.g., adding exercises, tracking progress) in automated test environments. Such tests are critical for ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience in real-world scenarios.


### 2. Volatile Data Storage
The application relies on in-memory data structures to store user sessions and workout information, which is inherently non-persistent.

- **Impact**: Users lose all data when the server is restarted, undermining the reliability and usability of the platform for long-term progress tracking.
- **Resolution**: The integration of a database management system such as SQLite or PostgreSQL is essential to enable persistent storage, ensuring user data remains intact across sessions and restarts.


### 3. Basic Authentication and Session Management
Authentication and session management are currently handled through browser cookies, which are limited in functionality and security.

- **Impact**: Cookies provide insufficient security for handling sensitive data, particularly in multi-device environments.
- **Resolution**: A shift to token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) would provide a more secure and scalable solution. This approach allows for stateless session management, enabling features such as session expiration, refresh tokens, and device-specific access control.

### 4. Outdated User Interface (UI)
The UI, though functional, lacks modern design principles and responsiveness.

- **Impact**: The simplistic design may not meet user expectations, especially when compared to contemporary fitness applications with highly engaging and visually appealing interfaces.
- **Resolution**: The adoption of modern frontend frameworks such as TailwindCSS or Bootstrap can enhance visual appeal and ensure the interface is optimized for various screen sizes and devices.

# What is Missing

Comprehensive Testing:
Unit Testing: Additional unit tests are needed to validate the functionality of core features, such as session and exercise management.
Integration Testing: More integration tests are necessary to ensure that the interaction between different components (e.g., backend and frontend) is stable and reliable.
End-to-End Testing: Automated testing that simulates user workflows (adding/modifying sessions, tracking progress) is currently lacking, which could help catch bugs in real-life scenarios.

# Potential Future Developments

Mobile Application:
Native iOS and Android Apps: Developing native mobile applications could provide users with a more seamless and accessible way to track their workout progress on the go.

Integration with Fitness Devices:
Wearables Integration: Syncing with popular fitness devices like smartwatches or fitness trackers to automatically track heart rate, steps, or calories burned during a session.

Real-time Notifications:
App Notifications: Currently, notifications (e.g., for completed sessions or reminders) are limited to basic methods. Implementing real-time, in-app notifications would enhance user experience by providing instant updates on their workout progress.

Integration of Multimedia (Optional):
Adding Exercise Videos and Images: If implemented, users will be able to add images or videos of exercises to visually guide them through workouts. This feature would be especially useful for new users unfamiliar with certain exercises.

Timer Functionality (Optional):
Exercise Timer: The possibility of adding a timer to track the duration of exercises could help users improve performance and ensure accurate rest periods between sets.

Social Features:
Progress Sharing: Introducing features that allow users to share their workout achievements or progress on social media or within the app community to foster motivation and engagement.

By addressing the current limitations and implementing these future developments, the "Six-Pack" application can offer a more robust, user-friendly experience, making it a comprehensive tool for fitness enthusiasts.
