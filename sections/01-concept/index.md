## Idea

The motivation behind **Sixpack** arises from the personal experiences of our team members with existing fitness applications. Many competitors in this market segment rely on subscription models, requiring users to commit to recurring payments to access full functionality. Additionally, these apps often provide a limited database of exercises, restricting user flexibility.

**Sixpack** addresses these shortcomings by offering a one-time purchase model at just **€0.79**, giving fitness enthusiasts unlimited access to create and manage personalized workout sessions without restrictions. This approach ensures both affordability and functionality, setting Sixpack apart in the fitness app landscape.
