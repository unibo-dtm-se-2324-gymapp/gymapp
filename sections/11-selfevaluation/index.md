# Self-evaluation

- An individual section is required for each member of the group
- Each member must self-evaluate their work, listing the strengths and weaknesses of the product
- Each member must describe their role within the group as objectively as possible. It should be noted that each student is only responsible for their own section

## Marta's section:

I think we made a simple, functional software that does what it has to do but that at the same time can be improved by adding new functionalities in order to offer a better product to the customer such as a timer or a way to link images or videos to the exercise.

Since we are a team of 5 people with no computer science background I think that what we did is a quite good for being our first software.

Especially at the beginning, my contribution has been to realize the initial blueprint of both the report and the artifact structure, to which Domenico added the login and registration mechanism afterwards.
However, talking about the report, I worked mainly on the versioning and the developer guide sections after deciding to split the tasks.

## Domenico's section:

At the start of our software engineering project, there was great enthusiasm due to our shared economics background and the ambition to build our first web app for demonstration. While Marta provided a solid starting structure, we faced challenges expanding the app, which at times shifted focus away from the report. I primarily worked on design and deployment section, but in the final stages, I also adjusted layouts in other sections.
Together with Alessandro, I worked on improving the app using AIâ€”initially attempting a rebuild while he enhanced the existing structure, which was eventually adopted. I later implemented the new registration and login page structures.

## Leilei's section:

As a student from economic background, me and Klaudia we were firstly assigned to the the 8th,9th and the 10th section of the report(which is cicd, userguide and devguide), but due to some technical understanding difficulties we changed our working flow, so i started working on my part which is the concept and the requirements section. During summer, we had difficulty meeting up with each other according to everybody's busy schedule, but in the end we managed to develop our final project. Thanks to my teammates i managed to contribute my efforts to our team work. Working in a team can both be difficult and chanllenging, i'm greatful for the bound we have build together and i'm looking forward to our futher improvements.

## Alessandro's section:

It took several steps to arrive at the current result, which on the whole respects the guidelines and the correct structure, but after several meetings and improvements, we managed to achieve something worthwhile for our training course. I mainly worked on improving the functionality and structure of the initial design set up by Marta, also using artificial intelligence tools. In the final stages, I developed some sections of the report, Validation and Development, and added some necessary requirements such as the license, that were previously missing. Initially, I was not as committed to the project as I should have been, the summer break and various commitments meant that I did not dedicate enough time to it, but then I made up for it, trying to put my best effort into the tasks I had taken responsibility for completing, I tried to respond to the lack of technical skills, collaborating and sharing with colleagues, highlighting the value of the team.  The project is simple, but with a good design and some interesting features, it can certainly be improved, for example through the use of a database for both personal information and the different exercises, the possibility of uploading files and finally the inclusion of a timer.
It was a good opportunity to understand the basic and essential elements of developing a software project, with a special focus on the importance of having a coordinated and active team.
