# Self-evaluation

As a student with an economics background, I was assigned, along with Klaudia, to complete the sessions number 8,9 and 10. Personally, I then worked on finishing the first and second sections of the project.
For Session 1, I did a lot of researches on how a fitness tracker application should look and gathered inspiration from existing apps on the market. I explored their features, user interfaces, and overall design to create a solid foundation for our project. This research helped us understand the expectations and standards in the market.
For Session 2, which focused on requirements, I collaborated with my colleague Domenico. He helped me refine the technical details and ensure everything was clear and well-organized. This teamwork made the process funny and inspiring.
At first, managing our project structure was a bit challenging for us.
However, with determination, hard work from my amazing team, we successfully brought everything together.
Working in a team is not always easy. It can be both difficult and challenging at times. However, this experience taught me a lot about communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. I am grateful for the bond we have built as a team and for the opportunity to grow together. I believe that this project has made us stronger as individuals and as a group.
I hope we can take on even more projects together in the future and achieve great results.
