# Self-evaluation
- An individual section is required for each member of the group
- Each member must self-evaluate their work, listing the strengths and weaknesses of the product
- Each member must describe their role within the group as objectively as possible. It should be noted that each student is only responsible for their own section
<h2>Marta's section:</h2>
I think we made a simple, functional software that does what it has to do but that at the same time can be improved by adding new functionalities in order to offer a better product to the customer such as a timer or a way to link images or videos to the exercise.

Since we are a team of 5 people with no computer science background I think that what we did is a quite good for being our first software.

Especially at the beginning, my contribution has been to realize the initial blueprint of both the report and the artifact structure, to which Domenico added the login and registration mechanism afterwards.
However, talking about the report, I worked mainly on the versioning and the developer guide sections after deciding to split the tasks.
