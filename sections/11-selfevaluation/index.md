# Self-evaluation

## Marta's section:

I think we made a simple, functional software that does what it has to do but that at the same time can be improved by adding new functionalities in order to offer a better product to the customer such as a timer or a way to link images or videos to the exercise.

Since we are a team of 5 people with no computer science background I think that what we did is a quite good for being our first software.

Especially at the beginning, my contribution has been to realize the initial blueprint of both the report and the artifact structure, to which Domenico added the login and registration mechanism afterwards.
However, talking about the report, I worked mainly on the versioning and the developer guide sections after deciding to split the tasks.

## Domenico's section:

At the start of our software engineering project, there was great enthusiasm due to our shared economics background and the ambition to build our first web app for demonstration. While Marta provided a solid starting structure, we faced challenges expanding the app, which at times shifted focus away from the report. I primarily worked on design and deployment section, but in the final stages, I also adjusted layouts in other sections.
Together with Alessandro, I worked on improving the app using AIâ€”initially attempting a rebuild while he enhanced the existing structure, which was eventually adopted. I later implemented the new registration and login page structures.

## Leilei's section:

As a student with an economics background, I was assigned, along with Klaudia, to complete the sessions number 8,9 and 12. Personally, I then worked on finishing the first and second sections of the project.
For Session 1, I did a lot of researches on how a fitness tracker application should look and gathered inspiration from existing apps on the market. I explored their features, user interfaces, and overall design to create a solid foundation for our project. This research helped us understand the expectations and standards in the market.
For Session 2, which focused on requirements, I collaborated with my colleague Domenico. He helped me refine the technical details and ensure everything was clear and well-organized. This teamwork made the process funny and inspiring.
At first, managing our project structure was a bit challenging for us.
However, with determination, hard work from my amazing team, we successfully brought everything together.
Working in a team is not always easy. It can be both difficult and challenging at times. However, this experience taught me a lot about communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. I am grateful for the bond we have built as a team and for the opportunity to grow together. I believe that this project has made us stronger as individuals and as a group.
I hope we can take on even more projects together in the future and achieve great results.

## Alessandro's section:

It took several steps to arrive at the current result, which on the whole respects the guidelines and the correct structure, but after several meetings and improvements, we managed to achieve something worthwhile for our training course. I mainly worked on improving the functionality and structure of the initial design set up by Marta, also using artificial intelligence tools. In the final stages, I developed some sections of the report, Validation and Development, and added some necessary requirements such as the license, that were previously missing. Initially, I was not as committed to the project as I should have been, the summer break and various commitments meant that I did not dedicate enough time to it, but then I made up for it, trying to put my best effort into the tasks I had taken responsibility for completing, I tried to respond to the lack of technical skills, collaborating and sharing with colleagues, highlighting the value of the team. The project is simple, but with a good design and some interesting features, it can certainly be improved, for example through the use of a database for both personal information and the different exercises, the possibility of uploading files and finally the inclusion of a timer.
It was a good opportunity to understand the basic and essential elements of developing a software project, with a special focus on the importance of having a coordinated and active team.

## Klaudia's section:

As a team of five individuals without a formal background in computer science, we successfully developed a functional software application that meets its core objectives.
It took us some time to develop the project, but fortunately, I had an excellent team to collaborate and exchange ideas with. Marta played a crucial role in its realization, as she was the first to establish the structure for both the report and the actual development of our project.
Domenico and Alessandro demonstrated outstanding teamwork, focusing on the project's core elements. Building on their work, I, together with Leilei, finalized the report's final sections with a greater emphasis on continuous integration, the user guide, and future improvements, leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance these aspects.
