# Self-evaluation
- An individual section is required for each member of the group
- Each member must self-evaluate their work, listing the strengths and weaknesses of the product
- Each member must describe their role within the group as objectively as possible. It should be noted that each student is only responsible for their own section
## Marta's section:
I think we made a simple, functional software that does what it has to do but that at the same time can be improved by adding new functionalities in order to offer a better product to the customer such as a timer or a way to link images or videos to the exercise.

Since we are a team of 5 people with no computer science background I think that what we did is a quite good for being our first software.

Especially at the beginning, my contribution has been to realize the initial blueprint of both the report and the artifact structure, to which Domenico added the login and registration mechanism afterwards.
However, talking about the report, I worked mainly on the versioning and the developer guide sections after deciding to split the tasks. 

## Domenico's section:
At the start of our software engineering project, there was great enthusiasm due to our shared economics background and the ambition to build our first web app for demonstration. While Marta provided a solid starting structure, we faced challenges expanding the app, which at times shifted focus away from the report. I primarily worked on design and deployment section, but in the final stages, I also adjusted layouts in other sections. 
Together with Alessandro, I worked on improving the app using AIâ€”initially attempting a rebuild while he enhanced the existing structure, which was eventually adopted. I later implemented the new registration and login page structures.
